## üçã History and Motivation
Lemon started as a custom bot for my server with simple ban, kick and other commands and also because I always wanted to learn how to code discord bots, over time it gained features like anime search, roleplay commands, points system, and some basic loggings, alot of commands has been removed from Lemon as well, but it's sure that I'll never stop working on Lemon!

## üçã About the Developer
That's me! I'm inthedark.org#0666 (759180080328081450), and I've been moderating Discord servers for over 3 years now and have been developing bots for over 3 months now, I've been programming for over 6 years, Coding was possible for me because of websites like [udemy](https://www.udemy.com) and [skillshare](https://https://www.skillshare.com) and some basic knowledge I got in my College. I own a couple of servers but be sure to join [this server](https://discord.gg/y9UCbWK2hJ) of mine as this will be my main server for bot development support and discussion. Presently I also moderate on servers such as Senpai Society, Land of Misfits, Haramistan, and a couple of more servers. I'm also the author of a few more bots you can find out if you join my server. My experience using discord and managing these servers has shown me many of the common issues that servers face when it comes to poor behavior and moderation inconsistency. I've built Lemon EC to try and solve as much as I can as this bot is still under development, and going through updates  pretty much everyday.
