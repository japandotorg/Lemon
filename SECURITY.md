# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This bot is not easy to use and is unsupported (not the bot I'm hosting but it will be unspported if you try to use it) because I've removed alot of stuffs before adding this bot in here,
and I've added this source code here because of transparency about how the bot works, Please respect the [license] before trying to use the soucce code or running the bot yourself.
