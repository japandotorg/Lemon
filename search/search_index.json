I'm inthedark.org#0666 (759180080328081450), and I've been moderating Discord servers for over 3 years now and have been developing bots for over 3 months now, I've been programming for over 6 years, Coding was possible for me because of websites like udemy and skillshare and some basic knowledge I got in my College. I own a couple of servers but be sure to join this server of mine as this will be my main server for bot development support and discussion. Presently I also moderate on servers such as Senpai Society, Land of Misfits, Haramistan, and a couple of more servers. I'm also the author of a few more bots you can find out if you join my server. My experience using discord and managing these servers has shown me many of the common issues that servers face when it comes to poor behavior and moderation inconsistency.

Lemon is probably a useful bot for your server if: \u2705 Your server is active and needs automatic management/moderation \u2705 You want to give more power to your moderators \u2705 You need a warning system with auto-punishment system Lemon is probably NOT the right bot for your server if: \u274c You aren't willing to learn how to use Lemon using this wiki or the dynamic help menu Lemon has \u274c You aren't able and willing to read this wiki to solve most problems \u274c You don't fully trust your moderators \u274c You and/or your mods don't have a solid understanding of English If any of the above apply, then Lemon will probably not be the best bot for your server, and you should consider searching on top.gg for a different multi-purpose bot. \ud83d\udc9b Requirements There are some light requirements for using Lemon. These requirements are in place to help save resources. Your server must meet all of the requirements below, or Lemon might automatically leave your server. * 40 or more human members - Lemon is a multipurpose moderation bot, and if you have fewer than 40 people, why do you need a bot to moderate anything? * More humans than bots - Adding a lot of bots to a server just wastes resources, and making 'bot collection' servers is generally frowned upon. No server should need more bots than humans. * Strong knowledge of Discord and Discord bots, and the ability to read documentation - Lemon is easy-to-use for admins and moderators, but only if they are willing to put in the time to read the documentation (this wiki). In general, asking for support for a question answered here will result in being redirected back to this wiki. * Follow Discord's Terms of Service - While not automatically detected, if a server is reported for ToS violations, Vortex may be manually removed. \u26a0 Please read these requirements; Lemon may automatically leave your server if it does not meet them! \ud83d\udc9b Adding Lemon to Your Server The first step is to make sure that Lemon is actually on your server! To add a bot to your server, you must have the Manage Server permission on the server. If you do, you can click this link to add Lemon to your server: \u26a0 Please read the requirements above this section; Lemon may automatically leave your server if it does not meet the requirements Click here to invite Lemon If your server isn't listed, make sure you are correctly logged in by visiting https://discordapp.com/login \ud83d\udc9b Check Lemon's Permissions For Lemon to operate correctly, it needs the permissions to be able to complete necessary tasks. The easiest way to achieve this is to give the Lemon role the Administration permission and drag it to the top (or near the top) of the role list, like so: \ud83d\udc9b Setting up Lemon The next step is configuring vortex for your server! You can type c!helpadmin1 and c!helpadmin2 to see the full list of settings commands, You can change the default c! prefix to anything you like if you don't like the default prefix by simply doing a c!setprefix <newprefix> . Don't worry if you forget the custom prefix you setup for the bot you can just @mention Lemon and type @lemon prefix and the bot will remind you the prefix you setup for your server. You can also check out the [[Full Command Reference|Commands]] to see what Lemon has to offer. Muted Role The Muted role is the role that (usually) can be applied to a user to prevent them from sending messages, adding reactions, speaking, and connection to voice channels. If you don't already have a Muted role you can create a Muted role in the role settings of the server with the permissions of your liking and add them to the channels (I'll soon add a setup feature so that people don't have to set it up manually), if you already have a Muted role you can c!setmuterole <rolename> to setup the Muted role, Lemon should be able to set it up automatically, but if she doesn't be sure to set it up manually with the command given above. Logs Lemon has various logs to keep track of different kinds of server activity. All commands for logs are found in the Admin commands, available via c!helpadmin1 and c!helpadmn2 or in the [[Full Command Reference|Commands]]. If your server is using the [[Warn system|Warns]], it is recommended to enable (at minimum) the ModLog. Moderator Role The Moderator Role is a role that allows a user with said role to use all Moderation commands. The full list of Moderation commands is available via c!helpmod as well as on the [[Full Command Reference|Commands]]. To set a role to be the Moderator role, use c!setmodrole <rolename> (for example, if your moderator role is called \"Staff\", you'd run c!setmodrole @Staff ). To disable the Moderator role, run c!setmodrole none . If no Moderator role is set, Moderation commands can only be run if the user has sufficient permissions natively (they would only be able to kick or ban someone with Lemon, if they could ban them via the Discord client as well). Also, make sure to check out the [[Moderator Guide]] for helpful tips for moderating with Lemon! Auto-Mod For full information about the Auto-Mod and its features, check out the [[Auto-Moderation]] page. You can check the default Auto-Mod settings using c!helpamin1 or c!helpadmin2 .","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"Getting-Started/#is-lemon-the-right-bot-for-your-server","text":"","title":"\ud83d\udc9b Is Lemon the right bot for your server?"},{"location":"Getting-Started/#lemon-is-probably-a-useful-bot-for-your-server-if","text":"\u2705 Your server is active and needs automatic management/moderation \u2705 You want to give more power to your moderators \u2705 You need a warning system with auto-punishment system","title":"Lemon is probably a useful bot for your server if:"},{"location":"Getting-Started/#lemon-is-probably-not-the-right-bot-for-your-server-if","text":"\u274c You aren't willing to learn how to use Lemon using this wiki or the dynamic help menu Lemon has \u274c You aren't able and willing to read this wiki to solve most problems \u274c You don't fully trust your moderators \u274c You and/or your mods don't have a solid understanding of English If any of the above apply, then Lemon will probably not be the best bot for your server, and you should consider searching on top.gg for a different multi-purpose bot.","title":"Lemon is probably NOT the right bot for your server if:"},{"location":"Getting-Started/#requirements","text":"There are some light requirements for using Lemon.

The first thing you'll want to do is check out what prefix Lemon is using on your server. You can always use the @lemon mention and use @lemon prefix to see if the server has an custom prefix set (If you can't use the @lemon callback , ask your admin or server owner if the bot has all the permission it needs to use the moderation commands or just sending message permission in channels) Also check out the [[Moderation Commands section in the Full Command Reference|Commands#-moderation-commands]] \ud83d\udd28 Moderation Commands Kick, Ban, Softban, Mute All of these commands are very straightforward. The syntax for each is c!command <@user/ID> [time] [reason] . All of these can be used with IDs instead of mentions if you prefer. Muting support time aspects such as seconds (s), minutes (m) and hours (h), and users will automatically be unmuted after the amount of time has passed. The reason is optional but highly recomended as it will be used in both Discord's Audit Log as well as Lemon's Moderation Log.

One of the cleaning command is c!purge and the other one is c!purgebot . You can only delete 2-100 messages with this command, there is no default so you'll have to mention the number every time you want use this command, and also remember that clearing messages older than 14 days is not possible as that is a rule set by discord developers themselves. There are some parameters for both commands that you can use, multiple parameters can be used at once. Running the command with 2 parameters is the same as running the command twice, each with one of those parameters. Purge Command Deletes the specified amount of messages from the provided channel. If no channel is given, the messages will be deleted from the current channel. If a member is provided, only their messages will be deleted from the chat.
